Time deposits are one of the savings products provided by banks to their customers besides regular savings. Deposits are banking products where customers deposit a certain amount of money to be stored in the bank for a long period of time. This money cannot be withdrawn before a specified period of time, for example 1 year, 5 years or 10 years. The advantage of deposits obtained by customers is that the bank's interest rate offered is higher than other banking products.
